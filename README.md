# Snake-Game
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Rust using the Piston game engine. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The game features smooth graphics, responsive controls, and a simple yet engaging gameplay experience.
